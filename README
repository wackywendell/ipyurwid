A prototype for an ipython frontend based on the Urwid library.

Requirements:
pygments (easy_install pygments)
urwid (git clone git://github.com/wardi/urwid.git) (easy_install version may be outdated)

This prototype demonstrates the use of widgets to make it work... it has an
output box, a colored input box, a completion box, and a help box.

Currently, functionality is limited. Run 'python fakeinterp.py'
to get it to start; commands are at the top.
There is no interpretation of code - the 'fakeinterpreter' simply spits the code
back out as output.
